2016 played a lot of hearthstone, knows classic pretty well
Played a bit of magic arena
Legends or runeterra
2016, gadgetzan, meanstreets

Hunter:
Beast first addition
"Oh lord" when seeing stats
Wanted to give a beast taunt, was able to add that directly
Decided to change the manna cost
Second card also a beast, added windfury because "there's not much windfury in hunter at all"

1st and 3rd are control hunter, vs other hunters would help hold them off
2nd card, late game finisher, almost out of cards, buff it with syngergistic beasts

Warrior:
"Armour is like.. classic"
Pirates for 2 and 3
"The end of a pirate deck"
First two, control warrior, slows the game down, syngergise with armour abilities
Spell damage pirate, whirlwind syngery, clear the board
Third, pirate lord if you have board control

Mage:
Combo mage, "keep yourself protected while drawing cards" "four mana would be too good"
Wanted to do arcane missiles for card 2 instead of 7 to a target card
More of a control card. 
Slow decks, build up to later, big minions, value.

After:
Wanted to make the arcane missiles effect instead of one big hit.
Once i worked it out, it was pretty good. Big stats matrix is too much, would be better to just add stats one at a time.

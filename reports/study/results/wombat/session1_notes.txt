Heathstone experience: year to a year and a half
played yugiho, played wow tcg, wow for 10 years
around 2017 played last, played when it came out

looked carefully though the existing cards
played hunter because it was wow main
theorzed wow class familiarity would assist in understanding cards


loved beasts and menagarie strats in pvp

card1:
first instinct to add a name to the card
was thinking about wow mechanics in the design of cards
would have liked heal to be a deathrattle
was unclear on how to modify stats
sees role as defensive, sacrifical card

card2:
pack leader card, apex dinosaur, inspired by apex
can summon cards out of your deck, matching creature type like dino
made it a beast to match hunter
role is a big swing card that gives you a board state out of nowhere
imagined a wolf that summons other wolves

card3:
wanted to make a spell or weapon, decided on aoe spell
initially made it targeted, struggled to find removal button
wanted aoe to clear groups of minions including hunter menagerie


warrior, card1:
thought of tank immediately
began designing all 3 cards at once
wanted a deathratte: return to your own hand
card3 trolly, neusance
card1: taunt tanker
card2: big swing, hard removal


mage:
card1:
gone with flavour of gaining mana
card2:
weak minion that heals the hero, sacrifices itself, cheap weak healing minion
card3:
BUG: hit turn for set stats and it said permanent
elemental that debuffs enemy minions attack and health


After:
75% able to make the things that they wanted
minion, spell and weapon options
past experience with RPGs helped understand interface, such as drag and drop and wording of effect
save button on every page
was on large screen

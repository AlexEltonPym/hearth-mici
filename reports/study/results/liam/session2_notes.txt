liam followup:
are the stats signficnant
hunter likes to use hero power
card 2 too powerful

changed card 1 to target minions as well
looked at the 1 drops for neutrals
realised card 1 dominated by elven archer, changed again

card 3 makes sense as card seems bad
tryed balanced before
-----
card 4: increased armour gained, no useful information, but behavied as expected
card 5: if i were to balance this card... its a buff to warrior
card 6: makes sense that it had little effect vs mage
confused at hunter stats, armour makes sense because you use hero power less
left warrior cards alone
requested additional stats from database
-----

card 7:
hero power usage reduced because better use of turn 5


card 8: hero power being used to remove warrior armour, more artifcat of arcane intellect replacement



card 9: really interested in big nuke, similar to magic the gathering card which they wanted to recreate
made sense that it increased damage vs warrior
spells cast makes sense because added card is a creature, dont think they can learn much from this

reduced mana cost and damage of nuke
wanted to give it 11 health, instead reduced damage

hard to tell if they had an impact for some cards, most of them made sense
some of that stats didnt mean anything to them
for example whether spells were cast or not didnt tell anything about impact on the game
overall surprised some were "trash", for example i didnt think about the elven archer card being dominated
interesting if played with elven archer to get 4 total elven archerish cards
some cards like card 2 made lots of sense

did make some changes

A couple of hours of hearthstone, novice. Played a couple of years ago.

Hunter

"Can i keep looking back at this for inspiration" [existing cards]

Wanted to make a card of each power/mana level
Regularly went back to reference existing hunter cards

Cheap => expendable
Pokemon evolving, summons eachother, buffs eachother


Warrior

Looked for inspiration again
Didnt want to make a second card involving summoning
Went back and changed the stats of a hunter card (3 => 4/4)

generic/damage card
A support card with more healing/armour (last two together in the same deck)


Mage
Imagined an elemental deck with a card that buffs elementals

Support card
Support/summoner card, in support of something that summons an elemental
Final card, anti-beast


After:
Would want to play a bit more to feel if they are powerful and how they would fit in a deck.
Would want to summon a paricular token rahter than a generic one

Wanted to add names. More freedom in what you can add to the cards.

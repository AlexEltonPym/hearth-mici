1. Does the interface facilitate the designs people wanted to make? What would help them?
2. How do participants feel about the feedback they are given? Was it expected?
3. Do participants make changes after being given feedback? How significant?

After the design task:
1. Were you able to create the cards you wanted to make?
2. What would you like to see added or changed to make the interface better?

At the followup:

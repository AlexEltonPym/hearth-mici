Research questions:
1. How can simulation data be used to help game content designers make decisions?
2. How do game content designers respond to feedback from simulations of their content? How does that change based on how expected/unexpected the feedback was?
3. Do game content designers make significant changes after recieving simulation data?


Goals:
1. Does the interface facilitate the designs people wanted to make? What would help them?
2. How do participants feel about the feedback they are given? Was it expected?
3. Do participants make changes after being given feedback? How significant?



Study 1 Questions:

Pre-interview:
1. How much experience do you have with Hearthstone or other CCGs?
2. When did you last play?

While designing cards:
1. What role do you see this card filling in a deck?
2. What impact do you think this card will have on games?

After the design task:
1a. How do you feel about the cards you created?
    1b. Were you able to create the cards you wanted to make?
2a. How did you feel about the interface?
    2b. Is there anything you'd like to see added or changed?

At the followup:
1. Did this card have the impact you were expecting?
2. Would you like to make any changes to your card?

Reddit script:
Hello Reddit,

My name is Alex, I’m a researcher at The University of Sydney studying how machine learning can assist in card design. I’m looking for participants for a pair of 30-minute studies. In the first half you will design cards for a mini metagame. In the second study, at a later date, you will review feedback on your cards after they have been simulated in many virtual games. Participants who complete both halves of the study are eligible for a $50 AUD Battle.net gift card.

If this sounds like something you would be interested in, please sign up for the first 30-minute study using this doodle poll: https://doodle.com/bp/alexelton-pym/hearthstone-card-creation

Research questions:
1. How can simulation data be used to help game content designers make decisions?
2. How do game content designers respond to feedback from simulations of their content? How does that change based on how expected/unexpected the feedback was?
3. Do game content designers make significant changes after recieving simulation data?


Goals:
1. Does the interface facilitate the designs people wanted to make? What would help them?
2. How do participants feel about the feedback they are given? Was it expected?
3. Do participants make changes after being given feedback? How significant?



Study 1 Questions:

Pre-interview:
1. How much experience do you have with Hearthstone or other CCGs?
2. When did you last play?

While designing cards:
1. What role do you see this card filling in a deck?
2. What impact do you think this card will have on games?

After the design task:
1a. How do you feel about the cards you created?
    1b. Were you able to create the cards you wanted to make?
2a. How did you feel about the interface?
    2b. Is there anything you'd like to see added or changed?

At the followup:
1. Did this card have the impact you were expecting?
2. Would you like to make any changes to your card?

Reddit script:
Hello Reddit,

My name is Alex, I’m a researcher at The University of Sydney studying how machine learning can assist in card design. I’m looking for participants for a pair of 30-minute studies. In the first half you will design cards for a mini metagame. In the second study, at a later date, you will review feedback on your cards after they have been simulated in many virtual games. Participants who complete both halves of the study are eligible for a $50 AUD Battle.net gift card.

If this sounds like something you would be interested in, please sign up for the first 30-minute study using this doodle poll: https://doodle.com/bp/alexelton-pym/hearthstone-card-creation






todo:
per turn
winrate always shown
croc instead of arcane intellect
change title


liam followup:
are the stats signficnant
hunter likes to use hero power
card 2 too powerful

changed card 1 to target minions as well
looked at the 1 drops for neutrals
realised card 1 dominated by elven archer, changed again

card 3 makes sense as card seems bad
tryed balanced before
-----
card 4: increased armour gained, no useful information, but behavied as expected
card 5: if i were to balance this card... its a buff to warrior
card 6: makes sense that it had little effect vs mage
confused at hunter stats, armour makes sense because you use hero power less
left warrior cards alone
requested additional stats from database
-----

card 7:
hero power usage reduced because better use of turn 5


card 8: hero power being used to remove warrior armour, more artifcat of arcane intellect replacement



card 9: really interested in big nuke, similar to magic the gathering card which they wanted to recreate
made sense that it increased damage vs warrior
spells cast makes sense because added card is a creature, dont think they can learn much from this

reduced mana cost and damage of nuke
wanted to give it 11 health, instead reduced damage

hard to tell if they had an impact for some cards, most of them made sense
some of that stats didnt mean anything to them
for example whether spells were cast or not didnt tell anything about impact on the game
overall surprised some were "trash", for example i didnt think about the elven archer card being dominated
interesting if played with elven archer to get 4 total elven archerish cards
some cards like card 2 made lots of sense

did make some changes
